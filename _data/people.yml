   project: I am working on building a radio beacon deployment mechanism for the Sub-T challenge robots. I have worked on initial modeling and prototyping, and am currently in charge of the software side. The project uses arduino and ROS to control stepper motors, allowing for the gentle lowering of the beacons onto the ground.

   project: As an Engineer of ARPG beginning in the Fall of 2019, I have worked on the design and manufacturing of mechanical systems to provide support to team MARBLE in preparation for the DARPA challenge. My team's first project involved the design and fabrication of a system to package, place and extend a set of transmitter beacons from a group of autonomous vehicles. It has been a pleasure to work alongside some of the Post Doctoral Researchers such as Dr. McGuire and I look forward to future challenges!

   project: Since joining ARPG in Fall 2019, I have been helping support the DARPA challenge team MARBLE through building mechanical systems. I have mostly been working alongside the other Research Assistants, and Dr. McGuire. The first project that I have been helping with is to design and build a system to stow, deploy and extend a set of radio beacons from some of the ground vehicles. It has been awesome to work with ARPG so far and I'm looking forward to see what comes in the future!
