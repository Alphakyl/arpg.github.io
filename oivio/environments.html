Description of what each environment page contains.

<!--
Each trajectory was (approximately) repeated three times with different light
intensities. As auto-exposure was enabled during capture, all sequences exhibit
a similar brightness profile. However, the amount of motion-blur varies
greatly. Below we see the same turn being executed with the dimmest light on
left and brightest light on the right.
