## Open Positions

ARPG is always seeking highly qualified postdoctoral researchers with interest in robotic perception. Interested researchers *should already have experience in at least two areas* among control theory, machine learning, field robotics, computer vision, or robotic planning. If you are interested, please send your CV and a cover letter to Chris (contact information on the ["People"](/people) page).

We are also always seeking highly qualified PhD students. Part of this process is considering funding sources likely to be available _at the time the potential student would start_, which is uncertain in the fall when future students are considering applications. This causes a bit of a paradox. Admissions decisions will only really be made around February. Please note that even if you send an email, you still need to apply and we still will go through your application and recommendation letters in detail. See the note below about emails.

## Location in Engineering Center

Finding us in the Engineering Center at CU Boulder is a bit challenging due to the architecture of the building. We are located in ECES 111, but frequently meet guests at the [south Celestial Seasonings Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/xchy4bb9AGP2) in the Center.

During business hours, parking is available at [Lot 440](https://goo.gl/maps/KGoprwhx8Ym). Be sure to purchase a timed permit at the kiosk. After hours and on weekends, parking is generally available at [Lot 436/494](https://goo.gl/maps/AbjdFj5Xd6E2) for free.

## Email and other contacts

For individual contact information, please look at our [personal page](/people).

If you're about to email us, please consider the following:

* Are you currently working with Chris?	Feel free to email him.
* Are you from an underrepresented group?	It is awfully difficult to break into the group of researchers who know each other, and I appreciate that. Please e-mail Chris.
* Are you simply telling us you applied?Thanks, but there is a low probability of a reply.
* Are you mass mailing every professor?	Please do not email. Don't worry, your application will still be read even if you don't email us.
* Are you sending a tailored "please accept me; we do similar work!" email? See the above comment about PhD applicants. And even if we don’t end up working together now, hopefully we’ll cross paths and learn from each other in the future!
