## Open Positions

For 2019 ARPG is seeking between 2-4 PhD students and a post-doctoral researcher. If you are interested, please send your CV and a cover letter to Chris (contact information on the ["People"](/people) page). The normal advice for sending such an email applies; most importantly, it would help if you could please express why you are interested in this research group in particular.

We look forward to hearing from you!

## Location in Engineering Center

Finding us in the Engineering Center at CU Boulder is a bit challenging due to the architecture of the building. We are located in ECES 111, but frequently meet guests at the [south Celestial Seasonings Cafe](https://goo.gl/maps/xchy4bb9AGP2) in the Center.

During business hours, parking is available at [Lot 440](https://goo.gl/maps/KGoprwhx8Ym). Be sure to purchase a timed permit at the kiosk. After hours and on weekends, parking is generally available at [Lot 436/494](https://goo.gl/maps/AbjdFj5Xd6E2) for free.
